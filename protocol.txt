runnerup (GH-601 transfer utility)

https://code.kryo.se/runnerup/

This file contains the reverse-engineered protocol description.

Analyzed by Erik Ekman <yarrick@kryo.se> with a GH-601 version 1.15.

The GH-601 communicates with 4800 baud.
The checksum is xor of each byte after the header.

===========================================
Waypoints:

Send:
02 	Header
00 01 	Length = 1
77 	Command
76	Checksum

Receive:
Header (0x77)
Length (16bit big endian)
Name, 7 bytes, zero-terminated
Type of icon
Altitude (unsigned 16bit big endian)
Latitude (signed 32bit big endian, divide by 100000 to get degrees, >0 = North)
Longitude (signed 32bit big endian, divide by 100000 to get degrees, >0 = East)
Checksum

===========================================
Training runs:

Send first:
02 	Header
00 01 	Length
80 	Command
81	Checksum
For next training run send
02 	Header
00 01	Length
81	Command
80	Checksum

Reply format:
Header (0x80)
Length (16bit big endian)
Start date of track (8bit year, add 2000, 8bit month, 8bit day)
Start time of track (8bit hour, 8bit minute, 8bit second)
Duration of track (32bit big endian, number of 1/10 seconds)
Distance of track (32bit big endian, number of meters)
Number of latlongs in this reply (16bit big endian, 0 if last reply) = X
Counter of total latlongs sent (16bit big endian, zero-based, 0 if last reply)
[
Latitude (signed 32bit big endian, divide by 100000 to get degrees, >0 = North)
Longitude (signed 32bit big endian, divide by 100000 to get degrees, >0 = East)
] = X times
Checksum
